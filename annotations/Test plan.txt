=== GROUND TESTS ===
Communication
  - Ground station commands/uploads are being received by vehicle when high telemetry is active
  - Messages are being prioritized on high telemetry demands without parsing/stream errors (considering no RF losses)
  - Turn off/on modems and verify signal loss/recovery on alerts
  - Turn off/on gps and verify signal loss/recovery on alerts
  - Saturate modem tx power and verify the correct handling of broken RF packets receipt
  - Acceptable latency perceived between AP attitude and artificial horizon (rotate IMU and see artificial horizon/airplane on screen)

  - Reboot systems (Reboot systems and verify clean bootup. measure time)
  - shutdown systems (Arm failsafes and shutdown system without activating them)
  - Upload an autopilot update using UploadFileToVehicle, reboot systems and verify the new version
  - Verify onboard computer behavior while in Waypoint Mode for 30 min. Verify CPU and memory using Telnet tunnel

Actuation
   - play with min/max/trim uS on different servo positions to verify runtime changing on servo positioning when setting up parameters
   - sweep servos to min/center/max values after setup and verify expected physical range
      - Aileron left    Aileron right
      - Rudder          Elevator
      - Throttle        Generic
      - Cam pan         Cam tilt
   - Use joystick to control servos and verify command latency

Hold controls (done with vehicle)
   - HOLD_ROLL_WITH_AILERON (activate zero and verify servo travel when rotating IMU)
   - HOLD_PITCH_WITH_ELEV_RUDDER (activate zero and verify servos travelling when rotating IMU around roll/pitch)
   - HOLD_IAS_WITH_THROTTLE (activate mid value and verify servo travel while blowing pitot)
   - HOLD_COURSE_WITH_YAW (do not test. is being bypassed by now)
   - HOLD_YAW_WITH_ELEV_RUDDER (activate any position and verify rudder/elevator travel when rotating around roll/yaw)
   - HOLD_ALTITUDE_WITH_PITCH (activate high altitude and verify rudder/elevator actuation)
   - HOLD_GROUNDSPEED_WITH_IAS (activate high groundspeed and verify throttle changing because of IAS_WITH_THROTTLE)
   - HOLD_IAS_WITH_PITCH (put vehicle in zero roll/pitch. activate high altitude and verify a negative elevator - trying to increase pitch)
   - HOLD_COURSE_WITH_ROLL (set a far course from current course and verify aileron trying to change roll)
   - HOLD_ALTITUDE_WITH_THROTTLE (activate high altitude and verify throttle actuation)

Flight Path Modes
   - No mode (configure not to keep stable and verify no changes in servos, activate keep stable and verify aleron servos traveling
   - Flight Director (hold/unhold speed/altitude/heading and verify servos actuation in right direction)
   - Loiter (activate a loiter and verify servos heading to destination)
   - Waypoint (activate a loiter and verify servos heading to destination. activate manual override on altitude and verify elevator travel)
   - Safety action (set 'loiter with roll descending' for link down, turn-off modem and verify servos actuation towards holding level/airspeed)

Mission management
   - Create a new mission with some waypoints
   - Create a route and add some waypoints to it
   - Define basic Rules Of Safety
   - Upload mission
   - Activate any waypoint and verify servos trying to head the direction

Mission RulesOfSafety
   - Configure RulesOfSafety as needed by OutbackChallenge docs
   - Turn off GPS link and verify if GPS recovery procedures are OK
   - Turn off modem link and verify if data link recovery procedures are OK
   - Turn off both links and verify if crashinator is being activated by FlightTermination hardware
   - Create a boundary near the vehicle, configure action 'loiter with roll descending' if passed boundary and physically cross the boundary to verify action taking place

Payload
   - Camera
      - Change camera servos setpoint by direct servo commands
      - Verify min/max servo travel angle and setup
      - Activate payload azimuth/elevation angle relative to vehicle and verify correct physical positioning
      - Activate payload azimuth/elevation angle relative to earth and verify correct physical positioning while rotating IMU (should not change orientation according to earth)
      - Activate different camera profiles
      - Change camera zoom and verify latency
      - Play with camera controls using joystick (azimuth/elevation/zoom)
      - Turn video transmitters on and verify good video quality for watching
      - Record transmitted video and verify good playback quality
   - Bottle drop dispenser
      - Activate bottle drop dispenser by commanding door state to OPEN
      - Create a mission waypoint, associate a PayloadActionWaypoint whose SENSOR1 state is TURN_ON and verify that when this waypoint is activated, the payload port is open for releasing the bottle
   - Right click map and select Bottle Drop planning
   - Fill options and click OK so that some waypoints will be created
   - Upload those waypoints to vehicle and activate the route. Verify activation.

Alerts
   - For testing each alert, cause the alert trigger, verify ground station awareness of alert activation and subs
   - Remove the alert condition while verifying ground station changing to 'clear' status
